Main program is in "main.m".

The Helmholtz_LoopTheta.m runs much faster than WaveEq_LoopTheta.m.

The dataset used are in a separate "Data" folder.

The 1D Burgers equation identification is not included in the main.m. The .m file for this task is Burgers_identi_1D.m, which uses the dataset Burgers_u1D.mat.
